Fast food for search engines!

What is it
----------
Project Paradax is a boilerplate to create websites that are highly optimized for search engines and equally fast. 
Keywords: jQuery, Bootstrap 3, Mustache, Hogan, microdata, schema.org, Requirejs, Node.js, SEO, search engine optimization, metadata, website performance and speed

Why use it
----------
Your HTML source code is important to search engines, while only the resulting view is important for the visitors looking at your web page.
In a Paradax project, HTML source content is structured using machine-readable microdata only, while the view is rendered with Bootstrap 3 Mustache templates. And it's all automated.
