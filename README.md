Fast food for search engines.

Project Paradax is a simple boilerplate to create websites that use only semantic microdata to structure HTML source code - perfect for indexing by Google, Bing and Yandex. 
In your browser, the structured content is automatically extracted with Javascript to feed compiled Bootstrap 3 Mustache templates that render the actual screens.
