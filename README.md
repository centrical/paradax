Fast food for search engines.

Project Paradax is a boilerplate to create websites that are highly optimized for search engines and equally fast. Your HTML source code is important to search engines, while only the resulting view is important for the visitors looking at your web page.
In a Paradax project, HTML source content is structured using machine-readable microdata only, while the view is rendered with Bootstrap 3 Mustache templates. And it's all automated.

Keywords: jQuery, Bootstrap 3, Mustache, Hogan, microdata, schema.org, Requirejs, Node.js, SEO, search engine optimization, metadata, website performance and speed
